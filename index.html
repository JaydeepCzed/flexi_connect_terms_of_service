                    <center><h1>Terms of Service</h1></center>
                    
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;By downloading or using the app, these terms will automatically apply to you – you should make sure therefore that you read them carefully before using the app. You’re not allowed to copy, or modify the app, any part of the app, or its trademarks in any way. You’re not allowed to attempt to extract the source code of the app, and you also shouldn’t try to translate the app into other languages, or make derivative versions. The app itself, and all the trade marks, copyright, database rights and other intellectual property rights related to it, still belong to Czed.<br></p>
                    
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Czed is committed to ensure that the app is as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, it reserves the right to make changes to the app or to charge for its services, at any time and for any reason. Czed will never charge you for the app or its services without making it very clear to you exactly what you’re paying for.<br></p>
                    
                    <h2>Payments, cancellations and renewals</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Payments are not managed directly by Smart Countdown or Czed, but through Apple App Store and Google Play Store via RevenueCat. If you would like a refund for the app PRO version, it should be managed directly through the <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204084" target="_blank" class="inline-link">App Store process provided by Apple</a> if you purchased the app in iOS or <a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/2479637?hl=en" target="_blank" class="inline-link">through the Google Play refund process provided by Google</a>.<br></p>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;If you purchase Smart Countdown PRO, the payment will be charged to your iTunes or Google account. If you purchase a monthly or yearly subscription, your account will automatically be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current subscription period unless you disable auto-renew. You can turn off auto-renewal at any time by going to your Account Settings on the App Store or Play Store after purchase.<br></p>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;After a cancellation of the subscription to Smart Countdown PRO, you will lose access to the content and features that was unlocked by the subscription and are available only for PRO users at the end of the last subscription period. You will earn the condition of free user again, with the same available content that all free users enjoy.<br></p>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Free trials are limited to one per iTunes or Google Play account.<br></p>
                    
                    <h2>Consent to share consumption data with Apple</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;By using our app and making in-app purchases, you consent to our sharing of data regarding your usage and consumption of purchased content with Apple, as part of our efforts to resolve refund requests. This information may include details about how you have accessed and interacted with the purchased content. The purpose of sharing this data is to help Apple make an informed decision regarding refund requests. We ensure that such data sharing is done in compliance with Apple's policies and only as necessary to process your requests.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Warranties and liability</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Smart Countdown app stores and processes personal data that you have provided to Czed, in order to provide the Service, like your countdowns and events dates. It’s your responsibility to keep your phone and access to the app secure. Czed therefore recommends that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the official operating system of your device. It could make your phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your phone’s security features and it could mean that the Smart Countdown app won’t work properly or at all.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;You should be aware that there are certain things that Czed will not take responsibility for. Certain functions of the app will require the app to have an active internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi, or provided by your mobile network provider, but Czed cannot take responsibility for the app not working at full functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any of your data allowance left.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that your terms of the agreement with your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the connection while accessing the app, or other third party charges. In using the app, you’re accepting responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you use the app outside of your home territory (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on which you’re using the app, please be aware that Czed assumes that you have received permission from the bill payer for using the app.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the same lines, Czed cannot always take responsibility for the way you use the app i.e. You need to make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of battery and you can’t turn it on to avail the Service, Czed cannot accept responsibility.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to Czed’s responsibility for your use of the app, when you’re using the app, it’s important to bear in mind that although Czed endeavours to ensure that it is updated and correct at all times, Czed do relies on third parties to provide information to the company so that Czed can make it available to you. Czed accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of relying wholly on this functionality of the app.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;At some point, Czed may ask you to update the app. The app is currently available on iOS and Android– the requirements for system (and for any additional systems Czed decides to extend the availability of the app to) may change, and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep using the app. Czed does not promise that it will always update the app so that it is relevant to you and/or works with the iOS or Android version that you have installed on your device. However, you promise to always accept updates to the application when offered to you. Czed may also wish to stop providing the app, and may terminate use of it at any time without giving notice of termination to you. Unless Czed tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end; (b) you must stop using the app, and (if needed) delete it from your device.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Changes to This Terms and Conditions</h2>
                    
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Czed may update this Terms and Conditions from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. Czed will notify you of any changes by posting the new Terms and Conditions on this page.</p>
